                <h3>Dawn of Consciousness</h3>
                <p>Morning broke slow over Otautau, though "broke" was too lively a word for the sluggish pall that clung to the township that day. The twenty-fourth of November, nineteen seventy-two, ought to have been an ordinary morning like any other, stitched together by the gentle hum of rural routine</p>

                <p>An intolerable Cry. Not the squall of an infant, nor the anguish of any creature known to these paddocks and pastures. It rose like a wound torn in the fabric of the morning, raw, ancient, and unplaceable. Birds scattered, their chorus cut mid-note. Dogs barked and then fell silent, whining low as though cowed by some presence unseen. Even the milkman swore his bottles rang with a hollow, unnatural pitch. In the small local weatherboard maternity hospital, curtains drawn tight against the grey, a child had been born.</p>

                <p>I was free from mother's womb. I came into this world with hair sable as the abyss betwixt the stars, and eyes so fathomless in their umber that they seemed to drink the very light from the chamber. The midwife, a woman whose hands had ushered countless infants into breath, faltered.Her eyes widened, her lips parted, yet no prayer nor comfort crossed them. For though swaddled and mute, my gaze was ancient, terrible, knowing a stare that seemed to carry memories ancient and secret</p>

                <p>My mother reclined in her white-linen bed, her skin pale with the exhaustion of labour and blood loss, yet her lips curved in a weary smile. She knew not—how could she?—that her agony was but the prelude to a torment yet unseen, coiled like a serpent in the folds of time, waiting its hour to strike.Outside, the town stirred uneasily. <br> In the quiet of her room, my mother slept, her smile faint, her breathing shallow. I lay swaddled at her side, eyes wide open, unblinking, drinking in the dim light of the world that had birthed me.In the heart of Otautau, a shadow lengthened. Not of cloud nor hill, nor any earthly obstruction, but of the inexorable hand of Fate itself. Thus, the peace was shattered.</p>

                <h3>House Of Unrest</h3>
                <p>The years that followed my birth did not unfold with pastoral peace but with a grinding discord, as though time itself turned against me. The tranquillity that once veiled Otautau faded to memory, and within our small home I grew in unrest. Something within me rebellion, or perhaps illness coiled in my body like a viper, unseen yet unrelenting. The towns physicians, cold in their craft, could name no cause and offer no cure. My pain was a riddle, my suffering a ghost.</p>

                <p>It was not the body alone that betrayed me, but the mind. Thoughts clashed and roared like a storm, a thousand voices rising and falling within. I could not silence them nor escape. The world of laughter and games beyond the window belonged to others. For me, every sound was an intrusion, every moment a battle against the noise within my own skull.</p>

                <p>In preschool I moved like a ghost among children. While they built towers and sang songs, I sat apart, staring into spaces they could not see. They sensed my strangeness and kept their distance, or else mocked what they did not understand. I longed not for attention but for recognition for someone to see me, truly see me. When none did, I turned to mischief, desperate to prove that I existed.</p>

                <p>My mother watched me fade behind eyes weary from sleepless years and unanswered prayers. She had conquered pain once to bring me into the world, yet now it returned not to her body, but her heart. Love warred with dread each time she looked at me. The gulf between us widened, silent and sorrowful, until even comfort became a stranger in our house.</p>

                <h3>The Restless</h3>
                <p>I was no ordinary scholar barely a mediocre one. From the moment I entered that grim institution, I was an exile among its ranks, a spirit misaligned with the world it sought to shape. The classrooms chalk dust and endless rows felt more like a cell than a sanctuary. My first teacher, kind and patient, tried to reach me, but her words drowned in the storm within thoughts clashing like armies, fears nameless yet relentless. To sit still was triumph; to think clearly, a dream. My eyes wandered always to the window, searching for my fathers truck and the promise of escape, a world unburdened by expectation.</p>

                <p>Curiosity betrayed me one weekend when I stole my fathers Pall Mall cigarettes, believing he chewed them. Beneath my bed, I bit into one, swallowed, and was seized by violent sickness. His wrath came swiftly, but it was his silence that cut deepest. His solace was amber and bottled, and I feared I was its cause, the source of his sorrow, my mothers tears. At six, I longed to ride to the pub and bring him home, but her trembling hands held me back. Even then, I felt like both child and curse.</p>

                <p>Fire became my tutor. First paper, then a bedspread, then, after Guy Fawkes, the hedge itself. The flames danced, the fire brigade roared, and the captains quiet rebuke to my father burned hotter than the blaze. Rage chased me down Merrivale Road, his fury the language I knew best. Then, when his back shattered, pills replaced the bottle, and silence swallowed our home. In my seventh year, a classmate and his mother died in a fire; I laughed nerves, not cruelty but they saw mockery. The torment that followed was its own slow burning inferno</p>

                <p>“Turn the other cheek,” my mother said. “Fight back,” commanded my father. So I did. I hurled a bully through the headmasters glasshouse and bore the punishment alone. The deputys belt cracked my palms, yet I laughed pain mistaken for defiance. That laughter earned me three more lashes. When my father heard, he took me for a milkshake and gummies, his first and only tenderness, sweet as it was bewildering. But betrayal followed swiftly; my class denied its longed for camp to Deep Cove, my parents unmoved. I learned then that neglect can wound more sharply than any belt</p>

                <h3>Bitch</h3>
                <p>Anger turned to rebellion. I called my mother “bitch,” ducked her swing, and fled to the solitude I craved. At twelve, I walked fifteen kilometres into the night, a runaway under indifferent stars. The constable found me and returned me to silence and scorn. Pain became my inheritance both of body and soul. When illness at last unmanned me, the doctors uncovered two hernias and a trapped testicle. Months of half days followed, my legs bound like a marionettes. In the hospital I met Dickybird, another exile. We laughed, defied, and raised mischief in our plaster prisons. Yet beneath the laughter lingered truth; we were both broken things, stitched by surgeons, bound by pain, brothers not by blood but by survival.</p>

The school locked down; he was caught near Lumsden, and astonishingly, he returned, no glasses, no shame, hailed as a hero by those who once scorned him. <br> My blood boiled.  while I spat, “I would never do that,” and fought, earning suspensions; my rebellion grew smuggling spirits into school until I faced expulsion, then left Winton behind, wandering madly through town until a friend brought me home to Otautau, darkened and haunted, my mind a relentless tide of noise.</p>

I was no longer a student, but a boy adrift without map, without compass, without mercy. A tempest of flesh and bone, unseen by all, unheard by all, a storm unspent, gathering still.
                Freedom, I had believed, would be my balm, the draught to soothe my long suffering soul. <br> I thought that once unshackled from the jeers of tormentors, from the bus, from the flagpole of disgrace, I might begin anew. Beyond those gates, I imagined some sanctified realm where I could become normal, though even then, I scarce knew what such a word could mean. Yet fate cruel, mocking fate had conspired otherwise. It began insidiously, a fevers whisper behind the eyes, a spark that would soon devour me.</p>

                <p>My limbs grew leaden, my skull heavy as stone. Then delirium seized me in its merciless grip.
                    They named it viral meningitis, as though the syllables could rob it of dread. But I knew it for what it was: a descent.
                    Hallucinations, hideous and profane, beset me. Faces dead, unknown, yet familiar crowded my sight. They spoke in voices like wind whistling through shards of glass. <br> And demons O dreadful demons! danced at the edges of vision, their eyes twin embers of baleful fire, gleaming with mirthless delight.
                    The walls themselves seemed to breathe, swelling and contracting as though the house were a living beast that watched, mocked, and hungered. Day and night lost all meaning, melding into one fever-soaked phantasmagoria where waking and dreaming were but reflections in the same black mirror</p>

                <h3>The Veil Between Here And There</h3>
                <p>Weeks passed or centuries. My body withered beneath the fevers tyranny, yet my mind burned ever brighter, unhinged, unbound. When at last the fever relented, I found not healing, but transformation.The earth beneath my feet no longer held firm; it shifted like treacherous sands, for I had glimpsed beyond the veil. <br> And the veil, merciless and unblinking, had stared back. <br>Something vast and ancient had stirred within me cruel, patient, eternal. The hallucinations faded, but the sense of being watched remained. <br> The air itself seemed heavy with presence. Had I recovered, or had something taken root within my soul? It toyed with me, not with words, but with feelings; dread, rage, and a solitude so profound it seemed almost sacred.
                I wore a mask of normalcy laughed, jested, pretended but beneath it, the noise raged on, whispering;  freak, outcast, curse incarnate.</p>

                <h3>Obsession</h3>
                <p>Violence became my dark obsession not for its gore, but for its cruel clarity. War, at least, made sense; there were enemies, weapons, and purpose. I dreamt myself soldier, mercenary, predator in a world that despised me. <br>I built traps, devised ambushes, studied Sun Tzu's tactics as written. My war was waged not in fields, but within the hollow of my skull. And when my father fell victim to one of my contrivances, guilt drove me to bury the darkness beneath routine. Yet the mind, once opened to the abyss, can never forget and the abyss once roused, never sleeps. <br>Then, upon a night steeped in silence, the world itself shifted.</p>

                <p>Moonlight, pale and merciless, sliced through my room like a blade. A hooded figure stood there, suspended above the floor silent, unreal. Its message thrummed through my bones: ancient, terrible, inevitable. Then it drifted through the wall and vanished. I felt no fear and that absence was the truest horror. Some buried part of me had always known it would come. It was not a dream, but a visitation. In the days that followed, its presence clung to me; sleep became a battlefield of whispers; <br> You are marked. You are watched. You are not alone. <br>  When I woke, trembling, blade in hand, the voice murmured within: You called it a dream. I call it an arrival. I have always been here waiting for you to open the door. And so I buried the words, though shallowly for the darkness now had a hood.</p>

                <p>TMy fathers voice echoed a wound that would not close. I laughed where I could, hid where I must, yet never truly belonged. <br>
                    I was not light. <br>
                    I was not ease. <br>
                    I was a tempest imprisoned in trembling flesh. <br>
                    In a final, futile bid for redemption, I joined the Conservation Corps at Telford Rural Polytechnic, labouring among moss draped halls and birdsong. For a moment, there was peace but fate, cruel mistress that she is, was not done</p>

                <p>It began, as such things do, with a Monday swathed in grey, cloud pressing low over Balcluthas fields. A summons came: “Gather your warmest things. The mountain above the Homer Tunnel awaits.”
                    We laughed and packed, joy clattering like chains through the van. Yet as Fiordlands titans rose around us, something within me stirred a serpent coiled in shadow.
                    Sin, I learned, comes dressed in company.
                    When one of our men laid hands upon a woman in our group, I acted. My thumb pressed deep into the crook of his collarbone, his body folding in agony. My voice hissed like something ancient;
                    “Touch her again, and I will snap your fingers like twigs.”
                    The others did not fear him. They feared me</p>

                <p>We reached the mountains ribs of stone and ice. The air thinned; the cold sank its teeth into marrow. I stumbled, delirious, whispers fluttering like ravens in my skull.
                    The woman I defended and another zipped their sleeping bags to mine fragile warmth against Deaths pale hands. By their grace, I lived.
                    Salvation came in the form of a white campervan and an American doctor, spectral as a guardian from fable. He treated our frostbitten folly; the project was abandoned.
                    But fate was relentless. Back in Balclutha, I was called to the diesel stinking shed. The man whose pride I had crushed went straight to his father, who laid a complaint to Telfords Manager. Lies were told. “One more incident,” the man hissed, “and you are finished here.”
                    And so I bent. I smiled. I waited.</p>

                    Days later came the crash, the hiss, the stink of oil. They dragged me before Mr. White, judge and executioner. “You,” he said, “are the problem.”
                    No hearing. No proof. Only accusation. I was expelled.
                    As I packed, he smirked in the doorway. I struck clean, sharp, to the throat.
                    Then exile. Southward I walked beneath a black sky, every gust of wind a whispered judgement.
                    A white car pulled over inside, the woman I had defended. “I amm sorry you were expelled,” she said softly.

                    At Sunnyside Mental Health Unit, they stripped me of name and self, fed me pills the colour of ash. When I emerged, I was hollow. The war with the entity had only begun.
                    At home, my mother spoke of redemption through faith, my father of speaking in tongues.
                    I laughed. “What god gives such power to a man who could never love his son?”
                    Silence fell like a shroud.
                    The entity laughed low and patient.

                    And in staying, I saw the truth; my war was not with them, nor the world, but with the thing that grinned from the shadows of my own mind. It waited, and I endured. But endurance is not salvation it is merely the slow art of not yet falling.</p>

                <p>That Saturday evening, dusk shivered across a puddle in the drive. I stepped out for a cigar and cool air. The smoke curled like pale ghosts from my lips. Then, the door creaked open.
                    <br> There stood my father. <br>
                      No thunder. No scowl. No silence carved from ice. <br>
                      He spoke softly of weather, of the week ahead. Then, sharp as a blade in the dark, he said the words he had never said before.
                      “I love you, son.”
                      <br>I gave no reply. <br> Like a sleepwalker, I followed him to my mothers car, loading tools, a hacksaw, vacuum hoses, duct tape. Harmless things for a caretaker. Yet the Entity hissed;

                    <br>Two officers arrived, their words cold and rehearsed. <br>
                    <br>“Mrs. Murch, we regret to inform you…”<br>
                    My father had been found at the quarry near Wallacetown, lifeless, unreachable.
                    We accompanied them to Southland Hospital. The corridor to the mortuary stretched endlessly, walls the colour of bone, air thick with antiseptic sorrow, and the foul stnch of death herself. Each step echoed too loudly, as though the place disapproved of the living.</p>

I walked. I always walked. Later, the house swelled with mourners faces I did not know, their grief worn like stage makeup. My mother cornered me, voice venomous.

                I said nothing. Silence became my confession.

                <p>The sky wept without tears that morning, a trembling veil over the world, unsure whether to mourn or vanish. We were four; my mother, my brother, my aunt, and I, each cloaked in black, grief stitched into every seam. Malcolm drove, the car a hearse for the living, cutting through Southlands wet roads toward Otautau, that ghost town of bowed heads and cold reverence. The Fire Brigade and Ambulance crew stood in ranks, honouring a man who never earned it. <br>

                    We met at a party; she said, <br> “You do not want to be here, do you?” <br>
                    She was right. <br>
                    By the river, her hand brushed mine and for one heartbeat, the Entity fell silent. She became my calm, laughter softening the edges of madness. She wouldd say, <br>“You are better than they think.” <br> I wanted to believe her.</p>

                    And I did. <br>slowly, cruelly, the way only the broken know how. She stayed through tears and promises until one Tuesday, she left.
                    <br>“I loved you,” she said. br “But you do not want to be loved.”

                    The rope was already tied.
                    <br>“Goodbye,” I said, as she hung up. <br>
                    When the line went dead, so did the last part of me that believed in love.
                    The Entity did not gloat this time. <br>
                    It only whispered soft, final. <br>

            <p>That night was still no thunder, no storm, only silence so deep it felt the world had stopped breathing. The house was empty, the walls hollow where her laughter once lived. The rope waited, coarse and frayed, an unremarkable tool for a final act. I tied the knot with the care my father once showed me. <br>
                The Entity whispered; <br>  “This is the only thing you have ever done perfectly.” <br> No note. Nothing left to say. <br>
                I stepped off. The rope bit, the world dimmed, and peace false, fleeting settled over me.
                Then came the snap. Not my neck. <br>
                the timber beam. All 98kgs of me snapped the fucking beam.</p>

                But survival felt like the cruelest punishment.

                And I believed it. <br> Three days later, they sent me home with a list of helplines. The world carried on children laughing, cars moving as though nothing had changed. <br> But I had. <br> The rope lay where it failed me; <br> I stared at it, not with fear, but recognition.</p>

            <p>One Saturday after returning to Dorset House in Christchurch, fevered and trembling beneath the rash of chickenpox, the fire alarm shrieked like a banshee through The halls. I staggered toward the lip of the fire escape stairs, upon taking a step towards the lip of I suddenly found things going blank and I fell. <br>
                Down, <br> down, <br> down. <br>like Lucifer cast from grace. Bruised and broken, I was helped back to bed. <br>

                It craved blood. <br>
                It demanded violence. <br>
                And I deleriously obeyed but not against others, but myself in their steed.
                Torso, Arms, Legs, Back, and gut.
                Each cut deliberate, unflinching the room bloomed red, still, that fiend stayed unsatisfyed.</p>

                I refused anaesthetic. <br> No mercy. <br> For I am the damned.
              Then came the sentence for my doing, sectioned under the mental health act. Committed to Sunnyside Psychiatric Hospital a name that mocked the broken.
                <br> A gown that would not tear.
               A bed that would not warm. <br>
               A name that was no longer mine. <br>
               Days bled into what seemed centuries my reality warped, until, at last, released but sedated, slower, hollow.

                So I fled north yet again back towards Christchurch, hitchiking, between Invercargill and Edendale I met a Valkyrie in denim and ink who stole cars and laughed in the face of death, when she pulled over and offered me a lift. <br>
                We parted company after one steamy night in Dunedin,as I rose early so I could vanish to Christchurch, seeking oblivion leaving her out of it.
                At the Palladium, liquor flowed like venom, and women mistook my ruin for charm. I was invited that night to accompany a beautiful young woman to her appartment that night.  <br>
                By dawn, I slipped into the street empty, cold of feeling, and alive.</p>

            <p>In Cathedral Square, two preachers shouted salvation to the indifferent sky, while standing prone apon ladders. <br>

               He whispered, “Jesus died for our sins.” <br>
               And I turned from him silent,  blade in hand, I began to inflict deep wounds upon myself. For I too bleed, not in parable, but in rivers of red, skin carved to bone, knife slick with my life. <br>
               I turned back toward him, showing him my sacrifice, and asking "Would you worship me too, for I have bleed?"

                Their boots tolled like funeral bells.
                <br> My screams, unrecognizable, echoed off concrete. <br>
                They took me not to cells, but back to Sunnyside. <br>
                Ah, Sunnyside its very name a cruelty. <br>
                Behind its sighing gates, I faced an inquisition of the soul,
                questions flayed what was left of my mind until only echo remained.
                hey called it suicide prevention. <br> I called it a cage. <br>
                Days dripped like poison, nights crawled with muffled cries from the torrmented.

So one night, beneath dim corridor lights and the shuffle of orderlies feet, I slipped away, a shadow among shadows. Past fences, gates, and security into the night. The air was mild and I was numb even now I am surprised my feet carried me to the Southern Hotel, a beacon of ruin. Inside, the air hung thick with beer and despair. <br>  I fed coins into the jukebox, offerings to a pagan god, and let bluegrass mourn for me, as I skulled glass after glass of Wild Turkey and burned away any reason or common sense. <br> And then I saw him <br> a man broad of shoulder, bearing the cruel likeness of him, my old man. <br> Rage surged, ancient and venomous. <br>
                “You,” I hissed, “You treated me like filth.” <br>
                He was not my father, only a stranger but in that moment of intoxication, he bore every sneer, every silence, every withheld kindness. <br> Words gave way to fists. <br> Chairs crashed <br> voices rose,  <br>sirens wailed.</p>

                Finally, I was released sent to respite care, a mental health charity. For a year, life was calm. Then came my birthday. A friend, bright and alive, invited me over. <br> One moment of warmth became passion beneath a shower’s spray — hot and extremely steamy. For a while, we lived like the newly reborn. <br> But the demons never left. <br> The fights began. <br> She said I scared her. <br> I tried to joke, foolishly, cruelly. <br>
                "You are so delicious you should be careful, I might want to eat you.” <br>

From the airport, I walked,  then cadged  a ride, just to get to the city centre There, the Entity roared. <br>  I wanted it gone. <br>  So I took every pill in my bag. <br>
                  I awoke six days later. “You were minutes from a ventilator,” a nurse said. <br> A guardian had sat with me every shift. I spent two more weeks in Sunnyside. No one wanted to deal with me but Dorset House did. Somehow, they still saw hope.
                  At Dorset, I met another woman fragile, radiant, haunted by anorexia. We fell in love, even became engaged. But her illness pulled us apart. She left me for another man, a friend of mine, ex-military, full of bravado and bullshit. <br> Months later, I learned he had dragged her into prostitution, abused her, reduced her to property. When she could take no more, she ended her life with a months supply of Doxepin, a cruel elixir meant to calm minds, not end them. <br>

                At my mothers door came the old question: “How long are you staying this time?” <br>

My mother, marble-pale yet steady as stone, drove me to Southland Hospital, stopping for petrol on the way. “Forgive me,” whispered the young doctor as she cut away the boot. Pain became a hymn from hell, four shattered toes, the fifths tip hanging by a thread of skin. No anaesthetic, no mercy, only the blade and the cut, then they Bound my foot and cast me into the cold, I healed slowly.

Booze dulled the hours, wages vanished as swiftly as they came, and I drifted through a void, tethered to nothing, sinking deeper into stagnations abyss. Then, like a cruel twist of fate, came a new woman. For a moment, the demons slept. I moved into her home with her young son and daughter, and believed, foolishly, that redemption might be near. <br> But illusions shatter swiftly. Four months in, as I brewed coffee, The daughters cries tore through the air, her mothers foot striking her, a five-year-old girl over a lost sock. <br> Rage surged, ancient and vile. The Entity clawed at its cage, begging for release. Yet I swallowed the darkness, found the sock, comforted the child, and cescorted the two children to school.</p>

            <h3>She Devil And The Beauty</h3>
            <p>Later, I faced her with calm fury. <br>
                “Do not raise your hand nor voice again,” I warned. <br>
                “If you do, I may not contain the dark that lurks within.” <br>
                She sought no help. <br> By weeks end, I fled. But before leaving, she introduced me to Christine a tall,  thin sexy brunette, her personality magnetic. <br> Her beauty was a reprieve I could not yet trust. I returned to Invercargill, gathered what little I owned, and escaped to my cousins home, my harbour of reprieve until I could begin anew.
                A month later, drawn by some unseen thread, I wandered through the Invercargill car auctions,purgatory of rust and old ghosts and bought a blue Datsun 200B, my weary chariot. <br> Later that week I ventured to Cash Converters, as I sought fishing gear to still my storm, but before I got to the stores door a voice pierced the air. <br>
                “Nigel…” <br>
                I turned. Christine sat there an apparition in daylight. </p>

            <h3>Oasis of Hope</h3>
            <p <p>What began as a visit became a life. Two weeks among strangers became a home. Tammi, her two-year-old daughter, golden-haired and bright, called me Dad. Her trust undid me. I chose them  Christine, Tammi, the fragile light of a new beginning.
                But choice invites consequence. The Entity stirred once more, its whispers crawling through my mind. Then, like a cruel echo, the former lover returned the herald of ruin. She spoke of a son, my blood, and kept him from me as punishment.
                
                Fate laughed again. During a forestry course, a tutor assigned a tractor to a man with narcolepsy. As I chained two logs, he slept, and the machine lurched. My right hand was crushed  bone and flesh ground between steel and timber. Pain became flame. Christine drove me to the hospital; the truth was grim my fourth metacarpal shattered.
                No work. No course. Only stillness. And in that stillness, Christines voice became my salvation.</p>

            <p>Then came light within the dark. Christine was with child. Her radiance rekindled something long dead. <br> Little Tammi, born weak of leg, became my purpose. Each day I pulled her gently on her tricycle until she walked, then ran. Her laughter became my hymn. In 1998, one quiet evening, I burst into the bathroom and asked
                <br> “Will you marry me?” <br>
                <br>Christine laughed. <br>
                “Yes, but you could have made it romantic.” <br>
                I grinned. “Seeing you naked in the bath is romantic to me.” <br>
                Her laughter softened my rage; the drink lost its grip. <br>

                <br> “He will grow out of it.” <br> We left misted Gore for Invercargill. On October 2nd, 1999, beneath a low sky, we wed in my mothers garden, a quiet rite of love and survival.</p>

                It waits. <br>Christine was with child again. My mother urged our return to Invercargill, for her mokopuna, her grandchildrens laughter. She bought us a modest home, three rooms, full of grace.
                I worked by day and night, cleaning the remnants of others lives. The foreman offered me the Mair contract, but Spotless hesitated. The plan crumbled to dust. The foreman resigned. And through the silence that followed, I heard it again <br>

Dutifully, I sought the troll, secured proof of my sickness, and brought it to my employer,  the troll, fused to her desk like some idol of bureaucracy. <br> She sneered, “We can not get a replacement. <br> You will have to work.” <br> And so, in that factory of blood and chill where carcasses danced and steel sang against bone, I laboured on sick, shivering, contagious.

            <p> <p>But before I could begin anew, came flame. That weekend, at Christines kin in Gore, chaos vaulted the fence, a man running past the window, smoke thick and black behind ahead of him. “The child,” Carol hissed. <br> “She leaves her daughter home while she works.” (sex worker) <br> I too ran. <br> The flames roared, the hose writhed like a serpent of desperation. behind the glass of the porch, a rottweiler was trapped, eyes wide with mortal fear. I opened the door just enough to grab the dogs collar I seized it, dragging it gasping from the inferno, the heat licking my back like Satans tongue I hastily clossed the door to prevent more oxegen getting in. The fire brigade came but alas too late, yet all survived — shaken, homeless, alive. They called us heros, but the word tasted of rust. There was no time for praise. The night shift awaited.</p>

Family first.” <br> They accepted my reason for not going along. I loaded my family into our chariot and drove to Colac Bay.

He spoke of myelin, paralysis, and slow unmaking. Fosbender left. Christine faded to shadow. My mother came, and she broke in my arms. Hospital life blurred into absurd ritual catheters, indignities, pity disguised as care.

Still, I walked, for silence breeds ghosts.

Invercargill stood unchanged, yet I was not the man who had left it. then after another year and no progress, a junior doctor told me I was making the whole thing up and I was fine, anger unleashed I told him to piss off back to his home country, Mr fosbender later amused, told me he would operate in a weeks time. </p>

By 2015, my body rebelled anew. Dunedin became my crucible.

From torment came miracle: a twitch, then motion. Four steps, four! Months later, a new doctor said softly, “You do not have multiple sclerosis. But there is something. You will be referred to the Isis Clinic, Ward Eleven.” Ten years I had lived beneath a false sentence. Freedom tasted strange — bitter, uncertain.

            <p>One physician spoke of a woman who went to bed whole and woke to find her arm blackened and bloated, crushed by an invisible hand yet every test was clear. <br> Christine and I were moved to private quarters. For two nights the air was still peace as brief as a drowning mans gasp. Then came the lodger, a mind unravelled by time. <br>Returning from therapy one evening, we were met by a stench, a grave wind clawing the gut. On the stove, a pot of boiling water and a tray of mince, plastic wrap and Styrofoam still intact. Madness manifest. <br>I struck the nurse call. <br>They came, they gaped, but the ward manager, warden of inertia, refused to act. <br>  The madman would stay.</p>

            <h3>treacherous Serpent</h3>
            <p>The night air turned heavy, tainted with dread. I saw him in every shadow, imagined poison in our food or fire in our sleep. At dawn, I phoned ACC to lament the theft of my wheelchair. <br>“Leave it with me,” a spectral voice replied. <br> An hour later, an orderly appeared, bearing my reclaimed chair like a relic wrested from oblivion. We begged the staff to move the madman elsewhere. They refused. So we left. <br> Outside, the heavens mirrored our turmoil. Rain lashed the earth, wind howled like unseen spirits, and I swore I heard that madman’s laughter in the gale. The road shimmered black and treacherous a serpent swallowing us whole. </p>

            <h3>Judgment</h3>
            <p>Three hours later, home at last, we collapsed into uneasy sleep. Morning crept in on the scent of coffee, and Tammi and Jaxson arrived, our room service angels. Then came 2018, a year of strange fortune. A sum of money appeared sudden, inexplicable. From it, a hunger awakened. I longed for a truck not merely metal and motion, but a dark chariot to bear me onward in strength and pride. <br>We searched across towns and miles until, one still Sunday morning, we hunted again at GWD Russells Holden in Invercargill. <br> “Can I help you?” asked a tall, bearded salesman. <br> “Yes,” I said. “We seek a Colorado Z71.” His eyes swept our plain clothes; his tone turned cruel. <br>“Come back when you have the money.”</p>

            <p>Christine stopped me. “If you go to jail,” she said, “he wins.” On Monday, I called the general manager, I was calm, but burning. <br>
                “We do have the money,” I told him. He apologized and asked us to return in two days. When we did, there she stood: a 2019 black-on-black Colorado Z71, gleaming like obsidian.
                 “Is this the one?” he asked. <br>
                “Yes,” I breathed. “Thats her.” <br>
                Four days later, I handed the teller a cheque for fifty-two thousand, one hundred and thirty dollars. The clerk looked at me as if I would conjured it from air. I held the keys—my talisman of destiny—and named her The Beast.
                Two weeks on the Sunshine and Gold Coasts we celebrated, before returning home just as quarantine sealed the nation. COVID-19 had wrapped its cold hands around the globe, but for me, confinement was nothing new. My life since 2002 had already been a kind of lockdown. Now, at last, the world had slowed to match the rhythm I had long endured.</p>

            <h3>Toxic Connection</h3>
            <p> <p>My Xbox had once been my lifeline, a portal to distant friends and unseen battles, after my injury, it became my escape, a way to drift from reality. Then came COVID, lockdowns, and the illusion of peace around the country was shattered. <br> By 2021, Tammi had fallen under the sway of a toxic couple and their disciple, Hannah. Whispers from others warned of manipulation, but she wouldnt listen. That summer, tempers flared old carpet torn up. Tammi lashed out, venom on her tongue, before fleeing to her cabin. <br>
                I followed, pleading for calm. Then he appeared,the corrupter his defiance a spark to dry tinder. The man shoulder barged me, I so wanted to deck him but Jackson called the police who strongly advised restraint, and for my familys sake, I listened. When we returned, after the police arrived to supervise the removal of her belongings we left for a few hours, and upon our return the cabin was empty. That Friday, she came back calm, hollow, resolved. <br>
                together we helped the cabin man prep for towing of the cabin. then when that was complete.
                “See ya,” she said chirpily climing into her wee Suzuki.
                And she was gone.</p>

            <h3>1 Chance Out Of 10</h3>
            <p>In April, my mother called my cell phone as Christine and I were finishing our junkmail runs, in panic stating the police at our house, needing to speak. <br>Jaxson sat pale beside two officers. <br>“Does Tammi own a silver Suzuki Swift?” “She does.” <br>“Shes been in a serious accident. <br> Trapped for hours. <br> Flown to Dunedin Hospital. <br> You must go now.”<br>  We drove through the dark, police lights flickering like ghostly fire. At the hospital, grim doctors met us. <br>“Severe brain injury, swelling, bleeding. <br> Survival less than one percent.”  <br>The words crushed me. At her bedside, machines screamed as I whispered, <br> “Dads here, baby girl. Fight.”  <br>We held her hands, but nurses sent us away. Grief followed us to the Leviathan Hotel ten minutes walk, yet worlds away.</p><p>Skyscrapers reached toward the heavens, monuments to human ambition and ingenuity. Each building told a story of dreams pursued, obstacles overcome, and the relentless drive to push boundaries ever higher.</p>

            <p>The next day, the Dunedin deceivers, those who had twisted her loyalty, caused such chaos we were banned from visiting. Rage consumed me; I struck a tree until blood ran. Seeking peace, Christine and I crossed the rain-slick road to Cobb & Co, where the maître d’ offered us free meals “For as long as we need after he heard of the tragedy. <br> he said "let neither hunger nor thirst trouble you.” <br> Mercy amid ruin. <br>  Meanwhile, my mother fought from Invercargill, and by the fith  day,<br> justice came <br> the deceivers cast out <br> the truth laid bare <br>But it was too late. <br>Three days of her remaining time were stolen.

             <p>Her wish as a donor was clear. At three oclock they would begin. We walked to her bedside her chest still rising, the cruelest illusion. “I will make you proud, my Angel,” I whispered. “I will become someone worthy of you.” When the machines fell silent, we were told; <br> a baby and a woman would live because of her. <br>Tammi had become their angel too. <br> Then came Lyndon, her biological father (Nothing but the sperm donor) a coward who once wished her terminated. <br> “She bears my name by choice,” I said. <br> “You are but a shadow.” <br> Shamed, he fled. <br>When the deceivers tried to steal her body, we bound her to us by law and sanctified her rest.</p>

            <h3>The Calling</h3>
            <p>When the day of Tammis funeral came, Banditos stood guard as we laid Tammi in a Minion-blue casket, bright, cruelly cheerful. Inside lay her Minions and our Chihuahua Zaras ashes, her guide to the next world as did the ancient Inca people. I placed a pounamu koru upon her chest, life, growth, eternity. <br> Lyndon stood silent as the lid sealed. <br>When Tammis ashes returned home, to Southland Crematorium not far from my childhood friend. <br>Her laughter stilled <br> her love eternal. <br> Winter grief gave way to Christmas warmth family gathered, laughter returning. In that light, I found my path to honour her through creation. Media Design School called; I fought bureaucracy and won.
                On February 24th, 2023, my journey began.

            <p>“The night is vast, and full of whispers; yet even in its deepest hollow, a single light may banish the void, if only we have the courage to walk toward it.”
                — E.A.P <br><br>

            <h3>Promises</h3>
            <p> There are promises that bind more deeply than any oath sworn before man or god, promises woven of love, grief, and the lingering breath of the departed. When I stood beside my daughters still form, I whispered a vow into the silence. <br>
          
                “I will make you proud, my Angel. I will rise. I will fight. I will become someone worthy of you.” <br><br>
                
                That vow became the pulse beneath every heartbeat, the quiet murmur that steadied my trembling hands through the long nights of doubt, and even as I study I am battling illness, along with my FND, I have an enlarged prostate, I was diagnoised 4 years ago with type 2 diabetes, but now they are testing me, as they suspect I might have type 3c Diabetes, caused by damage to the pancreas so if I can get through my issues, whats your excuse, are you gonna whine, mope and feel sorry for yourself or take control of your entity. Even now, when the world grows heavy and my resolve falters, I feel her, Tammi like a soft warmth upon my shoulders, her unseen touch urging me onward. <br>Through the halls of Media Design School, though I walk them from afar, her spirit walks beside me. <br>
                The aroha that flows through Media Design School is unlike any I have known: constant, nurturing, alive. Each student, tutor, and staff member carries a spark of it, and somehow, through the glass of my screen, that light reaches me.</p>

            <h3>Sea Of Aroha</h3>
            <p>  <p>I still remember the day I first visited the school. The welcome I received caught me entirely off guard. Such warmth was foreign to me, I had long been accustomed to the chill of indifference, to being unseen, unheard. <br>But that day, they saw me. <br> They embraced me not as a broken man, but as a creator, a storyteller, a student of purpose. And like a sponge long starved of rain, I soaked it in that rare, unguarded kindness. one of the lecturers Christophe, came to me and gave me the biggest hug I have ever had from a guy, he was so thrilled to finnaly see me in person, which had me thinking wow, these folk are bloody awesome.</p>

            <h3>Coroners Report</h3>
            <p>My time as a student has not been easy. I struggled as a mature learner, often caught between duty and dream. There were nights when pain and doubt gnawed at me, when study and circumstance pressed too hard upon my spirit. But always, in those moments, I felt her near a brush of unseen wings, a whisper of strength that was not entirely my own. And with the aroha of those around me, I have been keeping my promise. Then, last month, a letter came delivered by the cold, indifferent hand of officialdom. The coroners inquest finnaly 4 years after her death, reigniting the raw emotions. Within its pallid folds lay the verdict upon Tammis fate.Roading was slick with melted tar from the previous 3 years, but over all it was drivers error, Tammi lost control, even though she was driving to the speed limit, her inexperience led to her death.</p>

        <p>From the ashes of grief, pain, and loss<br>
        I wrote this story so that others may see<br>
        even when the night feels endless,<br>
        and hope lies buried deep beneath sorrow<br>
        the dawn can still break.</p>

        <p>I have walked through shadows that sought to consume me<br>
        Danced with death<br>
        faced storms that shattered my body and spirit<br>
        and yet, by clinging to the faintest glimmer of belief<br>
        I found the strength to rise</p>

        <p>Change begins when you surrender<br>
        to the possibility that life can be different<br>
        that you can be different<br>
        It is not weakness to stumble<br>
        it is courage to stand again</p>

        <p>To those who feel lost<br>
        Do not let despair write your ending<br>
        Seek connection, speak your pain aloud<br>
        accept help, and know you are never truly alone</p>

        <p>Keep your mind busy<br>
        nourish your body and spirit<br>
        hold fast to the small joys<br>
        a laugh, a memory, a sunrise</p>

        <p>For every moment you choose to keep going, you defy the darkness<br>
        Believe in your own worth<br>
        and let that belief guide you to a life rebuilt, a future reclaimed</p>
